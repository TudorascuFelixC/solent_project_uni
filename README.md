<br>

<h3 ><strong> Purpose</h3>

<h4>The purpose of this website is to address the common challenges faced by students in universities and provide them with a roadmap to navigate their hard learning journey successfully. It aims to empower students with the knowledge, skills, and support they need to overcome obstacles and achieve academic success.</h4>

<br>

<h3 ><strong>Target Audience</h3>

<h4>The target audience for this website is university students at various levels of study, including undergraduate and graduate students. It caters to students across different disciplines and academic backgrounds who are facing difficulties in their learning journey and are seeking guidance and support to overcome these challenges.<h4>

<br>


<h3 ><strong>Roadmap Creation</h3>

<h4>One of the unique features of the website is the ability for students to create personalized roadmaps to navigate their hard learning journey. Through the roadmap creation feature, students can access various resources, watch tutorial videos on YouTube, and track their progress by checking off completed topics.

> - Access Link Resources: The website provides a curated collection of link resources that cover a wide range of topics relevant to students' academic challenges. These resources include articles, blog posts, research papers, and other informative materials. Students can explore these resources to gain in-depth knowledge and insights related to their specific challenges. 

>- Watch YouTube Tutorial Videos: The website offers a selection of YouTube tutorial videos that provide step-by-step guidance on various subjects. These videos cover important concepts, study techniques, problem-solving approaches, and practical tips to help students overcome their learning obstacles. By watching these videos, students can enhance their understanding and acquire valuable skills.

>- Track Progress with Checkboxes: Each topic in the roadmap is accompanied by a checkbox. As students engage with the resources and complete the associated tasks, they can check off the corresponding checkboxes. This allows students to visually track their progress and easily identify the topics they have already covered.

By combining the accessibility of link resources, the visual engagement of YouTube tutorial videos, and the progress tracking through checkboxes, the roadmap creation feature empowers students to take control of their learning journey. It enables students to access relevant resources, acquire new knowledge and skills, and monitor their advancement towards academic success.</h4>
